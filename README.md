## Setup

I currently run [Arch Linux] with [i3] on my laptop and desktop.
- I use [lemurs] as my display/login
  manager
- I use [polybar] as my bar
  with a few custom modules.
- I use [Firefox Developer Edition] as my web browser.
- I use [ulauncher] as my program launcher.

For programming, I use [NeoVim] for most languages,
though I use IntelliJ for Java development, because there's still no
great way to do that in [Neo]Vi[m] (if you have ideas, please let me
know!).

I use two terminal emulators; [Alacritty] and [Guake] both running
[tmux] with [zsh] as my shell using [powerlevel10k]'s version of the
[pure] prompt

Most configs can be found in this repo.
